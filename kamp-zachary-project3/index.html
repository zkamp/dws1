      <h2>A Child-like Adoration</h2>
      <p>If my legs had an attached meter measuring movement through lifetime, it would
        register far more revolutions than steps. In fact I hardly ever walk anywhere
        unless I have to – from my office chair to get coffee, to climb stairs, visit
        the bathroom, enter a pub, or go to a meeting. I'd probably cycle to those too
        if permitted, and if it wasn't slightly dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>As cycling becomes more popular, I fantasize a little about just much humans 
        might ride in the future. The idea that we could evolve into part-bicycle is one 
        that pleases me immensely. It pleases me as much as reading Flann O'Brien's
        masterpiece of fiction, The Third Policeman, in which that very thought has
        wheels. In this wonderful book, several characters in its Irish village setting
        are described to not so much have ridden as to have partly swapped atoms with
        their bicycles. The postman, for one, has become 71% bicycle and, like many
        other locals, has developed behavioral traits such as regularly leaning
        against walls or, when at rest, having one foot on the curb.
      </p>
      <p>I began to love cycling from the age of three. I remember my first bike – a 
        little blue Raleigh with training-wheels, hidden in a cupboard. I remember the joyful
        rush when it was revealed. It may yet be my best, or at least most significant
        birthday present. I vividly recall the day the training-wheels came off two weeks
        later, my Dad running behind and not telling me he'd let go as I carried on 
        without falling. After that I was off. I remember many childhood crashes,
        including when my best friend and I decided it would be really good idea to
        ride on top of a 10ft wall. Clever. (My next bike was a gold-colored
        Grifter, but am still a bit sore that I never had a Chopper.)
      </p>
      <p>Last year I took part in a charity bike ride from John O'Groats to Land's
        End – 1,000 miles in just nine days. It was fantastic, but undeniably tough at
        times. But one of the things that amazed me was how fit and healthy some of the
        older cyclists were. The man mostly at the front was at least 50, tearing up
        road at tremendous speeds and leaving others gasping. At least one of the
        other riders was over 70. Cycling seems to be an activity you can keep
        improving at, even when past the conventional sporting peak of your late
        20s. So in that respect it seems to be like being music or writing, or
        wine, improving with age. I sometimes do other forms of exercise – a bit
        of running and swimming – but many of my friends who have played a lot
        of football – at least more than me – have completely worn their knees
        out. But cycling's low impact seems to only strengthen knees, and I
        feel that mine will last longer thanks to a lifetime in the saddle.
      </p>
      <p>When on a challenging trip or even in the city, cycling's culture of
        friendliness and mutual support, especially when you have a puncture or other
        breakdown, continues to surprise me. What other activities seem to inspire such
        camaraderie among strangers?
      </p>
      <p>Cycling must have its downsides, surely? Yes, but even they can have
        solutions. Admittedly cycling in snow is next to impossible, and or heavy rain
        unpleasant, but improvements in breathable waterproof clothing make that much
        more bearable, and doesn't stop my daily commute. And hills? They get so much
        easier with practice, like anything else. I've grown to love going uphill,
        perhaps as much as downhill. Here's a helmet cam clip of climbing a long 
        hill near Torquay in Devon, the birds singing, the wind whistling through
        the trees. Tough, yet tranquil, and very satisfying. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/bike-blog/2014/jun/19/why-i-love-cycling">Original Article</a>
