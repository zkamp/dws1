		<center><h1>I Like Bikes!</h1></center>
		<p>If my legs had an attached meter measuring movement through lifetime, it would
		 register far more revolutions than steps. In fact I hardly ever walk anywhere
		  unless I have to â€“ from my office chair to get coffee, to climb stairs, visit
		   the bathroom, enter a pub, or go to a meeting. I'd probably cycle to those too
		    if permitted, and if it wasn't slightly dangerous.</p>
		<p>As cycling becomes more popular, I fantasise a little about just much humans 
		might ride in the future. The idea that we could evolve into part-bicycle is one 
		that pleases me immensely. It pleases me as much as reading Flann O'Brien's
		 masterpiece of fiction, The Third Policeman, in which that very thought has
		  wheels. In this wonderful book, several characters in its Irish village setting
		   are described to not so much have ridden as to have partly swapped atoms with
		    their bicycles. The postman, for one, has become 71% bicycle and, like many
		     other locals, has developed behavioural traits such as regularly leaning
		      against walls or, when at rest, having one foot on the kerb.</p>
