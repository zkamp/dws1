		<h2>A Child-like Adoration</h2>
		<p>If my legs had an attached meter measuring movement through lifetime, it would
		register far more revolutions than steps. In fact I hardly ever walk anywhere
		unless I have to – from my office chair to get coffee, to climb stairs, visit
		the bathroom, enter a pub, or go to a meeting. I'd probably cycle to those too
		if permitted, and if it wasn't slightly dangerous.
		</p>
		<p>As cycling becomes more popular, I fantasize a little about just much humans 
		might ride in the future. The idea that we could evolve into part-bicycle is one 
	    that pleases me immensely. It pleases me as much as reading Flann O'Brien's
		masterpiece of fiction, The Third Policeman, in which that very thought has
		wheels. In this wonderful book, several characters in its Irish village setting
		are described to not so much have ridden as to have partly swapped atoms with
		their bicycles. The postman, for one, has become 71% bicycle and, like many
		other locals, has developed behavioural traits such as regularly leaning
		against walls or, when at rest, having one foot on the curb.
		</p>
		<p>I began to love cycling from the age of three. I remember my first bike – a 
		little blue Raleigh with stabilisers, hidden in a cupboard. I remember the joyful
		rush when it was revealed. It may yet be my best, or at least most significant
		birthday present. I vividly recall the day the stabilisers came off two weeks
		later, my Dad running behind and not telling me he'd let go as I carried on 
		without falling. After that I was off. I remember many childhood crashes,
		including when my best friend and I decided it would be really good idea to
		ride on top of a 10ft wall. Clever. (My next bike was a gold-colored
		Grifter, but am still a bit sore that I never had a Chopper.)
		</p>
		<p>Last year I took part in a charity bike ride from John O'Groats to Land's
		End – 1,000 miles in just nine days. It was fantastic, but undeniably tough at
		times. But one of the things that amazed me was how fit and healthy some of the
		older cyclists were. The man mostly at the front was at least 50, tearing up
		road at tremendous speeds and leaving others gasping. At least one of the
		other riders was over 70. Cycling seems to be an activity you can keep
		improving at, even when past the conventional sporting peak of your late
		20s. So in that respect it seems to be like being music or writing, or
		wine, improving with age. I sometimes do other forms of exercise – a bit
		of running and swimming – but many of my friends who have played a lot
		of football – at least more than me – have completely worn their knees
		out. But cycling's low impact seems to only strengthen knees, and I
		feel that mine will last longer thanks to a lifetime in the saddle.
		</p>
		<p>When on a challenging trip or even in the city, cycling's culture of
		friendliness and mutual support, especially when you have a puncture or other
		breakdown, continues to surprise me. What other activities seem to inspire such
		camaraderie among strangers?
		</p>
		<p>Cycling must have its downsides, surely? Yes, but even they can have
		solutions. Admittedly cycling in snow is next to impossible, and or heavy rain
		unpleasant, but improvements in breathable waterproof clothing make that much
		more bearable, and doesn't stop my daily commute. And hills? They get so much
		easier with practice, like anything else. I've grown to love going uphill,
		perhaps as much as downhill. Here's a helmet cam clip of climbing a long 
		hill near Torquay in Devon, the birds singing, the wind whistling through
		the trees. Tough, yet tranquil, and very satisfying. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/bike-blog/2014/jun/19/why-i-love-cycling">Original Article</a>
